# ZEHNER GROUP

Front End UI Developer Assessment



## INTRODUCTION

Take the file and spend no more than 4 hours breaking it apart and coding it up in html, css and javascript. There is no specific tools or frameworks in mind as part of the goal here is to see how you think and solve web development problems.

Once you have finished, please send a link to the github repository hosting your code, and any documentation you want to share about how you built it, work that you weren't able to finish, or anything else you think would help us evaluate the quality of your work.

## COMPLETED

- Spent a lot of times completing the navigation bar. Making sure it looks exactly like the PSD comp. 
- Juiced Logo is sliced out from the PSD file and saved it as PNG file.
- Hero image (turquoise background) was also sliced out from PSD file, but noticed the background image was less than 1200px wide. Added extra background color to the left to fit the screen and have text over an image. 
- Text over an image is done by using positioning relative/absolute. 
- Worked on the second part of the section "YOU BUY IT BY THE BOX" but was unable to finish it because 4 hours was up. 

### INCOMPLETE

I would like to take this time to explain the remaining page and how I would have finished it.

- The third section with "DRINKS" would have been done with text over an image as well using position: absolute/relative. 
- Will add carousel sliders and add indicator on the bottom to show what page viewer is in.
- The Fourth section "PICK YOUR PLEASURE" would be done with 4 different columns and on hover will add opacity of the image and add the text.
- "CLEANSE" would be done with position absolute/relative with text over image.
- "LOCATION" would be similar to "PICK YOUR PLEASURE" and add location below
- Footer would be simple html.
